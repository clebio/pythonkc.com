## Development Quickstart Option 1 (vagrant)

We're going to use Vagrant and Virtualbox to run pythonkc.com inside a Debian
VM. We're using the [shell provisioner][] to install Ansible inside our VM and
then using Ansible to manage the environment from there. (Note: we're *not*
using the [ansible provisioner][].)

First you need to install [Vagrant][] and [VirtualBox][] and clone [our
repository][] from github.

Now copy `pythonkc_site/.env.example` to `pythonkc_site/.env` and add
your own [meetup api key][] and a unique [django secret key][] (`.env` will
be ignored by git)

Then you have to install some vagrant plugins and build your vagrant box:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
vagrant up
```

`vagrant up` will run `provision.sh` which runs ansible on the VM.

We've done this so you don't have to install ansible on your local machine.

If you'd prefer you can always ssh in and run/re-run the provisioner manually
(the output is a little nicer this way):

```
vagrant ssh
cd ~/vagrant/ansible
ansible-playbook vagrant.yml
```

To run the Django development server:

```
vagrant ssh
django-admin runserver 192.168.100.101:8000
```

Now go to `http://192.168.100.101:8000` in your browser. You can edit the files
on your local machine and the server should reload automatically.

For now, this is a Python 2 project. If you want to start using Python 3
and help us fix our problems, set Ansible's `python_version` variable to 3
and it will build the virtualenv using Python 3:

```
ansible-playbook vagrant.yml -e python_version=3
```


## Development Quickstart Option 2 (virtualenv)

```
mkvirtualenv pythonkc
git clone git@github.com:pythonkc/pythonkc.com.git
cd pythonkc.com/pythonkc_site
pip install -r requirements/project.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

Profit! $$$
